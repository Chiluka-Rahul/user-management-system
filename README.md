# User Management Dashboard

## Overview

The **User Management Dashboard** is a web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details fetched from a mock backend API (`JSONPlaceholder`). The application emphasizes functionality, clean UI, responsiveness, and smooth animations.

## Features

- **View Users**: Display a list of users with details like ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
- **Add User**: Add a new user through a form with client-side validation.
- **Edit User**: Edit existing user details.
- **Delete User**: Remove users from the list.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through users with pagination controls.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations using Framer Motion.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly messages.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding animations to UI components.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **React Hook Form & Yup**: For form handling and validation.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and maintainable styling.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

1. **API Limitations**: `JSONPlaceholder` doesn't persist changes made through POST, PUT, or DELETE requests. This means that while the frontend can simulate these actions, the data isn't actually updated on the server. To address this, the application optimistically updates the UI based on successful responses, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. **Responsive Design for Tables**: Making tables responsive is inherently challenging due to their structured nature. Ensuring that the user list is readable and navigable on smaller screens required implementing a mobile-friendly layout, such as converting table rows into block elements on narrow viewports.

3. **Form Validation**: Implementing robust client-side validation using `React Hook Form` and `Yup` was essential to prevent users from submitting incomplete or incorrect data. Balancing validation strictness with user experience required careful schema design.

4. **Animations Performance**: Integrating `Framer Motion` for animations added to the application's aesthetics but required ensuring that animations were smooth and didn't hinder performance, especially when rendering lists or handling state changes.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**: Connecting the application to a real backend service would allow for persistent data storage, ensuring that user additions, edits, and deletions are reflected across sessions and accessible to all users.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more granular error messages based on different failure scenarios, providing users with clearer guidance on issues encountered.

3. **State Management Optimization**: As the application scales, integrating a state management library like Redux or Zustand could enhance state handling, especially for larger datasets or more complex interactions.

4. **Advanced UI Features**: Incorporate more advanced UI components, such as modals for confirmations, tooltips for additional information, and better form controls to enhance user interaction.

5. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensure that the application adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG), making it usable for individuals with disabilities by implementing proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

6. **Testing**: Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive unit and integration tests, ensuring that all components function as expected under various scenarios.
